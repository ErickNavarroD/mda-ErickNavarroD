# Milestone 3
This folder contains the source for Milestone 3.

In this stage, I manipulated special data types in R, such as factors and dates and times to produce new plots that sharpened my results. Also, I fitted a model object to my data to get statistical results for the question *Do games with a better review score tend to be the most popular?*, and extracted the result. This model, and a summarized table were saved in the output file. The .md version can be found [here](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-ErickNavarroD/blob/main/Milestone_3/mda_milestone_3.md)
