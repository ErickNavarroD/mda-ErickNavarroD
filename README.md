# Welcome to my Mini Data Analysis Project!
This project is part of STAT545A

## Content
This repository at the moment has only one main file: the [Milestone 1 Rmarkdown file](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-ErickNavarroD/blob/main/mda_milestone1.Rmd); it can be ran in R.   

But you should better check its [md version](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-ErickNavarroD/blob/main/mda_milestone1.md)! (the knited file); it can be opened in github, so it is a faster and easier way to check my project. 

I hope you enjoy it!
