# Milestone 1
This folder contains the source for Milestone 1.

This is the starting stage of the project, and comprises mainly the exploration of the available datasets for the assignment, their variables and their relationships. At the end, I chose 1 dataset for the following stages (steam_games()), for which I formulated 4 potential research questions that could be solved with the variables. The research questions formulated were:
- Q1. Do recent released games have better reviews than the older ones?
- Q2. Are games with better reviews the most expensive ones?
- Q3. Do games with a better review score tend to be the most popular?
- Q4. Which developer produces the most popular games (i.e games with more reviews) or the ones with the best reviews?
