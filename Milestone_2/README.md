In this stage, I manipulated, summarized and made plots of the variables in the `steam_games()` dataset to answer the questions that I formulated in the previous step. After observing the results and, I narrowed my research questions to only 2 research questions that were the most interesting to me, and finished with a tidy dataset that can be used to solve them in the next stage. The .md version can be found [here](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-ErickNavarroD/blob/main/Milestone_2/mda_milestone_2.md). The chosen research questions were:   
- Q1: Do recent released games have better reviews than the older ones?
- Q2: Do games with a better review score tend to be the most popular?
